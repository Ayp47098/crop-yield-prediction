## ðŸŒ¾ Agriware: Crop Yield Prediction using ML

Agriware is an intelligent web application that helps users predict **crop yield** based on key inputs like location, land area, crop type, and season. It also suggests the **best crops** for cultivation and provides helpful **harvesting strategies**. With high prediction accuracy, the app supports both **regional and global datasets**, making it a valuable tool for farmers, researchers, and agribusinesses.
